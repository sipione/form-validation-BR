# form-validation-BR

It's a simple form that I used as a way to demonstrate some hard-skills mainly in JavaScript. In the begginig some premises must be addressed. 

At the first, I'm not a skilled designer, but I can achieve what a professional designer can imagine. Furthermore, the main idea of this repository is to draw attention to code writing patterns, such as the BEM standard, creation in CSS, document organization in JS dividing the responsibilities of functions and files, modularization of them, in addition to the logic itself programming to calculate the age of majority, tax payer number and use of API to automatically fill in the postal code fields.

The second premise is, this form follow the brazilian system of identification, as the tax payer number pattern, the zip-code, the full-name in the same field, the laber text content in Portuguese, etc. So, if you are a foreigner, during this readme I will give you examples of values to be filled in while I explain how this form works.

If you would like to see it working goes to http://dogs.sipione.tech/register.html

This readme i will dedicate to rewrite and make it beauty. I just upload all the archives in order to publish, but i'll construct a good documentation to this project. 

Thank you all.
